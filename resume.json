Before entering the field of web development, he worked in Washington, D.C. as a construction manager, mostly focused on overseeing the completion of bridge and metrorail projects. While his work now focuses on fullstack web development, with a focus on React and Node, his non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing to chaos theory. He'd love to buy you a coffee or beer and tell you all about it!",
